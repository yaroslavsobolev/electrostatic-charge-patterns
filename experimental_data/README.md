Experimental data files (6.72 Gb altogether) are too
large for Github in 2022, so these files are in a different repository
(Harvard Dataverse) and should be downloaded from a [repository in Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZOFDKM)

Unzip and merge  into this folder. Folder `PDMS-PMMA_delamination_experiments` 
contains experimental data except the SKP mapping. SKP mapping data is
contained in the `improved_kp_kelvinprobe` folder in subfolders of same names
as subfolders in `PDMS-PMMA_delamination_experiments`.

`SEM` is for Scanning Electron Microscope images.
