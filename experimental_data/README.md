Experimental data files (XX Gb altogether) are too
large for Github in 2022, so they are in a different repository
(Harvard Dataverse) and should be downloaded from this link:

Unzip and merge  into this folder. Folder `PDMS-PMMA_delamination_experiments` 
contains experimental data except the SKP mapping. SKP mapping data is
contained in the `improved_kp_kelvinprobe` folder in subfolders of same names
as subfolders in `PDMS-PMMA_delamination_experiments`.
