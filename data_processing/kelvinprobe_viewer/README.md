Scripts for postprocessing and visualization of scans made by improved KP kelvin probe
and optional correction for tribocharge decay with time (not used in present paper).

`viewer2.py` is the primary script for just viewing the SKP scans.

`moving-averages.py` is for studying moving-average charge density with 
different windows (Supplementary Figures S14-S18).
