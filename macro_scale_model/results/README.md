# Simulation results

This folder is for storing the output of `macro-scale.py` script performing
numerical simulation of ESDs that accompany the stamp detachment process.

Calculation results published in the paper (XX Gb altogether) are too
large for Github in 2022, so they are in a different repository
(Harvard Dataverse) and should be downloaded from this link:

Unzip each calculation result in `/macro-scale-model/results` 
from repository and merge into this folder.
